# My-work-on-Data-Science

This is repository is created in order to document my codes which I have been working on in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. This repository mostly consists of my own solutions of the problems listed in the text book "Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)".

This book is considered as one of the primary first read books for those who are planning to step in to the field of data science. My documentation of the problems mentioned in this book will facilitate me to have a look at these concepts any time in future.

Also, if you are an employer this will probably give you an idea of what all concepts I know. I will keep updating this repository on regular basis as far as possible. (This readme text file too!)
